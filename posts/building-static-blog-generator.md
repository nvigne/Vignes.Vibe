# Building a Static Blog Generator

Creating your own static blog generator is a fantastic way to understand how modern web development works while having complete control over your content and presentation.

## Why Static Sites?

Static sites offer several advantages:

### Performance
- **Lightning fast**: No database queries or server-side processing
- **CDN friendly**: Static files can be cached everywhere
- **Minimal resource usage**: Serves files directly

### Security
- **Reduced attack surface**: No server-side code execution
- **No database vulnerabilities**: Content stored as files
- **Simple backups**: Just copy the files

### Simplicity
- **Version control**: Content lives alongside code
- **Easy deployment**: Upload files anywhere
- **Low maintenance**: No complex server setup required

## The Tech Stack

For this blog generator, I chose:

```javascript
// Core dependencies
import { marked } from 'marked';        // Markdown to HTML
import fm from 'front-matter';         // YAML front matter parsing
import chokidar from 'chokidar';       // File watching for development
```

## Key Features

### Markdown Support
Write posts in Markdown with YAML front matter:

```markdown
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: "2025-06-12"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---

# Your content here
```

### Automatic Generation
The build process:
1. Reads all `.md` files from the `posts` directory
2. Parses front matter and converts Markdown to HTML
3. Applies templates to generate final HTML pages
4. Creates index and archive pages automatically

### Development Workflow
- **Watch mode**: Automatically rebuilds on file changes
- **Local server**: Preview your blog locally
- **Hot reload**: See changes instantly

## Next Steps

In future posts, I'll dive deeper into:
- Adding search functionality
- Implementing RSS feeds  
- Optimizing for SEO
- Adding comment systems

Building your own tools is incredibly rewarding - you learn so much and end up with something perfectly tailored to your needs!
